* Write Arbitrary instance for PTNets and write QuickCheck tests
* M-bisimilarity
  - think of performing the check without statespace
  - better types?
* PTConstr
  - Make `label' more abstract/general? (Attach labels to positions)
  - Figure how to use a Monoid (and some typeclass for PTConstr)
    to replace 'toPTNet' with more general 'toNet'
* NPConstr
  - toSArc function: change to make use of possible monoidal structure of SArc?
* XMLReader
  - idToPlace and idToTrans are too ugly
